## Cohort Analysis
-------------
Cohort analysis takes a selection of data from a larger data set, over a period of time, and instead of looking at all the users as one single unit, it segregates them into smaller related groups based on different types of attributes for analysis.

It is a tool to measure user engagement over time. It helps to know whether user engagement is actually getting better over time or is only appearing to improve because of growth.

Here I have used a dataset to build a cohort analysis using python that shows the retention rate of the business Month on Month.
